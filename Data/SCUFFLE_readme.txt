SCUFFLE is the Soul Callibur live frame data UFFLE reader
---(https://github.com/rougelite/SCUFFLE)---
* SCUFFLE works in windowed or borderless windowed mode only (NOT IN FULLSCREEN)
* Launch SCUFFLE and Soul Calibur 6 at the same time and the overlay should display during fights
* It's probably gonna break after official patches, then you must wait for a kind hearted soul to update it
