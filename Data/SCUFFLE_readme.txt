SCUFFLE is the Soul Callibur live frame data UFFLE reader
---(https://github.com/rougelite/SCUFFLE)---
* SCUFFLE works in windowed or borderless windowed mode only (NOT IN FULLSCREEN)
* Launch SCUFFLE and Soul Calibur 6 at the same time and the overlay should display during fights
* It's probably gonna break after official patches, then you must wait for a kind hearted soul to update it

KNOWN ISSUES:
* It's the first release, everything sucks, whaddya expect. If your character has character specific stuff that doesn't work, be sure to tell someone or aint' gonna get fixed.
* Knockdowns and launchers don't give useful frame data
* Supers and unblockables are messed up
* Some moves, particularly launching moves like 3B and while rising B moves, gain an extra frame of startup after the move begins, be suspicious of any move with an odd number of startup frames
* Stun during strings seems to be about 4 frames more than one would think by subtracting the block stun from the startup
